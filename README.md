# Automatic License Plate Detection System
# Project Description
The Automatic License Plate Detection (ALPD) system is designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in images or video streams. The system uses image processing techniques to localize and segment the license plate, followed by character recognition to extract the alphanumeric characters. This solution can be applied to various scenarios such as toll collection, traffic monitoring, parking management, and law enforcement.

# Workflow
Image Acquisition: Images or video frames are captured from a camera system, typically installed on a road, parking lot, or toll booth.

Preprocessing: The image is enhanced using techniques such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement to improve the visibility of the license plate.

License Plate Localization: Using edge detection and contour analysis, the system identifies the region in the image that contains the license plate. This is done by recognizing the rectangular shape and specific aspect ratio typical of license plates.

Character Segmentation: Once the plate is localized, the individual characters on the plate are segmented for further processing.

Character Recognition: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques are applied to identify the alphanumeric characters on the license plate. Machine learning or deep learning algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy of this step.

Post-Processing and Verification: After character recognition, additional checks such as matching recognized patterns with valid license plate formats are performed to ensure accuracy.
